# ATM-SIMULATOR-BY-TKINTER
** Overview **
      This is an ATM simulator program with a graphical user interface built using the Tkinter library in Python. The simulator includes basic ATM functions like withdrawal, balance checking, deposit, changing the PIN, and exiting the application. It also features a proposed hand gesture biometric authentication system for added security.

** Features **
      User-Friendly GUI: The ATM simulator provides an intuitive graphical user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the system.

ATM Functions:
   Users can perform standard ATM operations, including:

Withdrawal: Enter the desired amount to withdraw.
Balance Checking: Check the account balance.
Deposit: Deposit funds into the account.
Change PIN: Change the ATM PIN.
Proposed Hand Gesture Biometric Authentication: The system includes a feature for hand gesture biometric authentication. Users are required to enter a 4-digit PIN, and if it matches the predefined PIN, access is granted. Otherwise, a message informs the user that the PIN is incorrect.

** Customization ** : 
     The code can be easily customized to adapt to different user requirements, such as integrating with a real bank's backend or enhancing security measures.
